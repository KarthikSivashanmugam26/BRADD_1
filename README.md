# 🖤 BRADD — Bring Requests And Deliver Done

### A JARVIS-Inspired Voice-Driven AI System

BRADD is a **personal, voice-first artificial intelligence system** inspired by Marvel’s **JARVIS**.
It listens, thinks, speaks, predicts, and executes tasks — all while keeping user data **private, encrypted, and cloud-secured**.

This project demonstrates **AI engineering, system design, data science thinking, security, and real-world deployment**.
